Tic Tac Toe
===========

My first program in Haskell, written at
[Hacker School](http://http://www.hackerschool.com/).

Compile with `ghc main.hs` and run with `./main`.

Players take turns to enter moves of the form "A1" or "a1" where the letter
is the column and the number is the row. Entering "end" ends the game.
